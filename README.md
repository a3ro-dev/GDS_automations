## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally with the `gemma3:4b` model, if using Ollama personalization.
- GROQ API key configured in `.env` (if Ollama is unavailable).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/GDS_automations.git
   cd GDS_automations
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```env
   USER_NAME='usrnm'
   USER_PASSWORD=G'pswd'
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key  # Only needed if Ollama is not available
   ```
   **Note:** The values above are placeholders. Never commit your real credentials. Ensure that your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` and kept out of version control.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
- Log in with the credentials defined in `.env` (or use defaults).
- Navigate between **Cold Email Generator** and **Delegate Management** from the home page.
